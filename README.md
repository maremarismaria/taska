# Taska

## What is Taska?

A pretty simple web app to manage projects and tasks, inspired by [MeisterTask](https://www.meistertask.com/en), for testing:
* AngularJS 1.5.8
* Web Storage (localStorage)
* Bootstrap 4.0

## Known issues:
*  **Projects**: if you delete the first project, Taska won't know what to do. :cry:

## To-do:
- [ ] Fix issues
- [ ] Clear forms and close modals on submit
- [ ] Drag & Drop
